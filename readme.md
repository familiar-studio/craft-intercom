## Craft Intercom

A simple plugin to load the In-app communicator for Intercom into craft.  Once setup, if the user logs in (either front end or control panel), the intercom widget will display in the lower right of the screen.

Setup
* Add plugin files to the plugins folder
* Fill in your intercom app id and secret in the plugin settings
* If you want to have intercom to only show for a certain user group, fill in that setting.  Leaving it blank will load the communicator for all logged in users
